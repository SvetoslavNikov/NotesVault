The main difference is that before we run the code we have to compile the whole source code(in the case of java to byte code) and if there are any compile time error the code would not even run. Where in the case of interpreted language like python or JavaScript the code is executed line by line. 
If there is mistake on line 3
- compiled - won't be executed
- interpreted - will execute line 1, 2 and then stop
