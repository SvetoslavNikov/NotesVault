A **WAN** (Wide Area Network) is a network that covers a much larger geographic area than a LAN, such as a city, country, or even globally. It connects multiple LANs (or other networks) together, allowing devices in different locations to communicate.

Some key points about WANs:

- **Large area**: A WAN can span a large distance, connecting devices across cities, countries, or continents.

- **Lower speed**: WANs tend to have slower speeds compared to LANs due to the larger distances and the technologies used for transmission.

- **Public or private**: WANs can be privately owned (like a corporate WAN) or publicly accessible (like the internet).
 
- **Connectivity**: WANs use various technologies, such as leased lines, fiber-optic cables, satellites, or even the internet, to connect LANs.

In short, a WAN is like the "network of networks" that connects different LANs, enabling communication over long distances, such as between offices in different cities or countries.****
