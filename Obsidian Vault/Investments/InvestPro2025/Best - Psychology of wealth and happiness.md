## Wealth is never defined, objective, it always depends on the surrounding.

Although every human today is on average 2-3 times richer, the inequality makes it seems like misery. Unlike your grandpa who only eat a little meat once a weak, wears 3th generation clothes  and have not seen a banana, now we complain why we don't have a cool apartment and go to holiday 4 times a year.  

Social media destroys the happiness, because expectations are not kept in check by your surrounding neighbors , but by the top 1% posting bs!

# Enough!
